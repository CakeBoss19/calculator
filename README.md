# calculator
A fully functioning calculator.

This calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators
you typically find on simple calculators. I will start by creating functions for the following items and testing them in my browser's console.

-- add
-- subtract
-- multiply
-- divide

Next, I'll create a new function (operate) that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the the above functions on the numbers.

Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an 'Equals" key.

-- Do not worry about wiring up the JS just yet.
-- There should also be a display for the calculator, go ahead and fill it with some  dummy numbers os you can get it looking right.
-- Add a "clear" button.

After the HTML/CSS has been written, we will continue with addition of the already written javascript functions.
